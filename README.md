# Code Refactor

## Description

For this project, we took a working code and refactored it, while keeping the same appearance, by using:

- HTML semantics
- Matching CSS to the changes made to the HTML file
- Consolidation of CSS selectors and properties
- Adding <code>alt</code> to all images
- Fixing any broken links on the page

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and apply ways to make a site more accessible. By making it more accessible, it ensures people with disabilites are able to use other technologies to access the site. It also helps the site to be ranked higher by search engines.

## Result

The below picture is the final result. You are unable to tell the difference from the original appearance versus the final appearance after code refactoring
